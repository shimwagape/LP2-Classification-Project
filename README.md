Churn analysis for a telecommunications company

### Overview

The backbone of every business are those who patronize it, in this case customers. They are the ones that determine the value of products or services that businesses offer. Every business is built around the customer, for which reason, without the customer, there really is no business. Businesses strive to get new customers all the time but are also concerned about customer retention. This has made customer churn a very important metric for any serious company or business.
Customer churn is the loss of any customer for any reason possible. In this analysis we will be taking a look at the possible reasons for the loss of customers in a telecommunications company. We also aim to build predictive models that will identify customers that are likely to churn and the factors that lead to them doing so to enable the company to take proactive steps to keep customers.
